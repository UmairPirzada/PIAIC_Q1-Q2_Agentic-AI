    "above code, Python initially reads the first line of the loop:\n",

    "This line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list magicians\n",

    "then reads the next line:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(magician)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python prints the current value of magician, which is still 'alice'. Because\n",
    "the list contains more values, Python returns to the first line of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "for magician in magicians:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python retrieves the next name in the list, 'david', and associates that\n",
    "value with the variable magician. Python then executes the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(magician)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python prints the current value of magician again, which is now 'david'.\n",
    "Python repeats the entire loop once more with the last value in the list,\n",
    "'carolina'. Because no more values are in the list, Python moves on to the\n",
    "next line in the program. In this case nothing comes after the for loop, so\n",
    "the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re using loops for the first time, keep in mind that the set of\n",
    "steps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items\n",
